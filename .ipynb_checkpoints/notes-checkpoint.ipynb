The power density at a distance $d$ from the attenna is $P_T\\big/(4\\pi d^2)$$\\text{W/}\\text{m}^2$. If the transmitting antenna has some directivity in a particular direction, the power density in that direction is increased by a fdactor called the antenna gain and denoted by $G_T$. In such case, the power density at distance $d$ is $P_TG_T\\big/(4\\pi d^2)$$\\text{W/}\\text{m}^2$. The product $P_TG_T$ is usually called the effective radiated power (ERP or EIRP), which is basically the radiated power relative to an isotropic antenna, for which $G_T=1$."
